***Methods for calculating the Shock Exposure Index (SPSS for CO pilot users); Piloted version - 6 shock profiles***

*define labels for Shock Incidence - these labels will need to be adapted based on the 6 shocks collected*

Variable labels
TypeFlood        ‘Did your household experience excessive rains/flooding within the last year?’
TypeDrought        ‘Did your household experience variable rains/drought within the last year?’
TypeHail         ‘Did your household experience hail/frost within the last year?’          
TypeSlides       ‘Did your household experience variable landslides/erosion within the last year?’
TypeCrop         ‘Did your household experience crop disease within the last year?’
TypePests          ‘Did your household experience crop pests within the last year?’

Value labels 
TypeFlood
TypeDrought
TypeHail
TypeSlides
TypeCrop
TypePests
0.00 'No'
1.00 'Yes'. 

EXECUTE.

*define labels for Shock Severity*

Variable labels
SeverityFlood          ‘How severe was the impact of excessive rains/flooding on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’
SeverityDrought        ‘How severe was the impact of variable rains/drought on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’
SeverityHail           ‘How severe was the impact of hail/frost on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’         
SeveritySlides         ‘How severe was the impact of landslides/erosion on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’
SeverityCrop           ‘How severe was the impact of crop disease on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’
SeverityPests          ‘How severe was the impact of crop pests on your households food consumption/income over the last 12 months?’

Value labels
SeverityFlood
SeverityDrought
SeverityHail
SeveritySlides
SeverityCrop
SeverityPests
1.00 'No impact'
2.00 'Slight decrease'
3.00 'Severe decrease'
4.00 'Worst ever happened'.

*Compute Weighted Average per shock*

Compute SEIFlood = (TypeFlood*SeverityFlood).
Compute SEIDrought = (TypeDrought*SeverityDrought).
Compute SEIHail = (TypeHail*SeverityHail).
Compute SEISlides = (TypeSlides*SeveritySlides).
Compute SEICrop = (TypeCrop*SeverityCrop).
Compute SEIPests = (TypePests*SeverityPests).


EXECUTE.

*Compute Total Shock Exposure*

Compute SEI = sum(SEIFlood, SEIDrought, SEIHail, SEISlides, SEICrop, SEIPests).
Variable labels SEI 'Shock Exposure Index'

EXECUTE.
